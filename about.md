# About Me

![Headshot](/images/headshot.jpg)

I’m a mechanical engineer focused on building reliable hardware for biology and automation—where precision fluid handling, test methods, and manufacturability all meet. I like challenging R&D problems that mix rapid prototyping, cross-functional collaboration, and a bit of creative problem-solving. When I’m not in the lab or shop, I’m outside skiing, biking, or playing music.

## Experience

**Mechanical Engineer — Xellar Biosystems**  
- Develop microfluidic devices and automated tools for cell-culture workflows.  
- Lead prototyping & testing for new devices, author test plans, and collaborate with biology/software to integrate hardware with automation systems.

**Mechanical Design Engineer Co-op — Portal Instruments**  
- Improved disposable device components; designed fixtures for R&D/manufacturing.  
- Worked on high-viscosity fluid handling and repeatable fill processes.

**Mechanical Engineering Co-op — Solchroma Technologies**  
- Built a leak-detection system to validate a production process.  
- Designed experiments to select polymer/adhesive interfaces for a critical device stack.

**Landry’s Bicycles & Outdoor Recreation**  
- Trail design and hands-on mechanical work.
