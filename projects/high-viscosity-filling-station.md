## Problem
Existing filling relied on a high-viscosity hand pipette—slow, operator-dependent, and prone to scrap. We needed a precise, repeatable way to fill multiple cartridges simultaneously without contaminating internal walls.

## Approach
- Designed a **modular clip system** to hold 5 cartridges and set needle height by fill level.  
- Implemented a **pneumatic linear actuator** with spring return to insert tips, fill, and retract.  
- Added a **small inline flow valve** to tune actuator speed for controlled operation.  
- Constrained tip motion using a **miniature carriage & rail system** for positional accuracy.

## Results
- Multi-cartridge filling with improved repeatability and reduced handling time.  
- Eliminated fluid contamination on cartridge walls.  
- Stable, reproducible vertical motion of tips; better fill-level control.

## If I iterated again
- Redesign the base for improved stability and cleaner integration.  
- Replace printed enclosure parts with machined components for tighter tolerances.
