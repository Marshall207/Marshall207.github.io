# Northeastern Electric Racing Dyno

![Render](/images/ner-render.jpg)
*Four-roller chassis dynamometer render.*

## Context
Senior Capstone project for Northeastern Electric Racing (student EV team). Requirements: limited footprint, maneuverability, long test duration.

## Approach
- **Modular frame** for transport and reconfiguration.  
- **Auxiliary roller** added to improve stability/adjustability with repurposed main rollers.  
- **Electromagnetic braking** to manage heat and extend test time.  
- Custom **connection plates & fixtures** to enable four independent test sections.

## Outcome
A robust dyno platform suitable for comparative vehicle assessments and training; optimized for stability, cost, and runtime rather than peak-power certification.
