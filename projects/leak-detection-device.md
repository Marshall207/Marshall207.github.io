## Problem
Production couldn’t validate an intricate multilayer device until late in the process, creating high risk and delays. We needed a way to detect small leaks layer-by-layer during assembly without damaging the delicate structure.

## Approach
- Designed a **manifold** that distributed pressure to 6 electronically selectable zones, allowing leaks to be pinpointed per layer and region.  
- Implemented **6 electronically controlled valves** to automate zone selection.  
- Created custom **silicone gaskets** and a **foam compression seal** to apply even pressure without constraining device movement.  
- Developed a **test stack** with opposing pins to align layers during evaluation.

## Results
- Reliable identification of micro-leaks early in the process.  
- Faster root-cause analysis and improved throughput.  
- Lessons: seal system design, complex 3D-printed manifolds, and disciplined test methods.
